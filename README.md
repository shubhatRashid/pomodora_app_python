* Pomodoro starts with 25 minutes of work, you need to focus for 25 minutes. 
* Once the 25 minutes, time period is done, using the Tkinter messagebox you can prompt the information. 
* The same goes for the break period as well.
* Now once we have imported the required libraries, the next thing is to create a GUI interference.
* Pomodoro means “Tomato” in Italian. In order to make this GUI look realistic, we will use a Tomato image as the background image. 
* You can add the background image to the Tkinter application using the Canvas widget. Finally speaking about the final part of the project is to program the * countdown timer.
